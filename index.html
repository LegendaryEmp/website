            <p>The benefit of being a member of our Society is the opportunity to get involved in your Co-operative</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a business owned by our members we want you to be involved.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We want to be proud to trade in the heart of many communities, where we strive to provide both local activities and support for our members.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a member, another way to involve yourself with your Co-operative is to attend meetings regularly and vote in the Society's decision elections, and by attending our Annual General Meeting.
